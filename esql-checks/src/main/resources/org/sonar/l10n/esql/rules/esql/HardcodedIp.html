<p>Hardcoding an IP address into source code is a bad idea for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a redeployment is required if the address changes </li>
  <li> it forces the same address to be used in every environment (dev, sys, qa, prod) </li>
  <li> it places the responsibility of setting the value to use in production on the shoulders of the developer </li>
  <li> it allows attackers to decompile the code and thereby discover a potentially sensitive address </li>
</ul>
